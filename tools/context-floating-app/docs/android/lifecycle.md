# Lifecycle in Jetpack Compose Part of [Android Jetpack](/jetpack).
Lifecycle-aware components perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of the host activity. The [`androidx.lifecycle.compose`](/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/compose/package-summary) artifact provides dedicated APIs that automatically clean up resources when they leave the screen or when the application goes into the background.
Key APIs include the following:
  * [Flows](/kotlin/flow) for the current [`Lifecycle.State`](/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/Lifecycle.State).
  * `LifecycleEffects`, which lets you run a block based on a specific [`Lifecycle.Event`](/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/Lifecycle.Event).


These integrations provide convenient hooks to manage lifecycles within the Compose hierarchy. This document outlines how you can use them in your app.
**Note:** The APIs described in this document were introduced in [Lifecycle version 2.7.0](/jetpack/androidx/releases/lifecycle).
## Collect lifecycle state with flows
Lifecycle exposes a `currentStateFlow` property that provides the current `Lifecycle.State` as a Kotlin `StateFlow`. You can collect this `Flow` as `State`. This allows your app to read changes in the Lifecycle during composition.
    
    val lifecycleOwner = LocalLifecycleOwner.current
    val stateFlow = lifecycleOwner.lifecycle.currentStateFlow
    …
    val currentLifecycleState by stateFlow.collectAsState()
    
The preceding example is accessible using the `lifecycle-common` module. The `currentStateAsState()` method is available in the `lifecycle-runtime-compose` module, which lets you conveniently read the current Lifecycle state with a single line. The following example demonstrates this:
    
    val lifecycleOwner = LocalLifecycleOwner.current
    val currentLifecycleState = lifecycleOwner.lifecycle.currentStateAsState()
    
## Run code on lifecycle events
Instead of creating a separate class that implements [`DefaultLifecycleObserver`](/reference/androidx/lifecycle/DefaultLifecycleObserver) and manually adding it to the lifecycle, you can declare lifecycle logic inline using specific effects. `LifecycleEffects` lets you run a block when a particular `Lifecycle.Event` occurs directly within the composition.
### LifecycleEventEffect
Use [`LifecycleEventEffect`](/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/compose/package-summary#LifecycleEventEffect\(androidx.lifecycle.Lifecycle.Event,androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleOwner,kotlin.Function0\)) to run a block of code when a specific event occurs. This is best for one-shot events like logging or analytics, where neither success nor an immediate outcome is needed.
    
    @Composable
    fun AnalyticsTracker(screenName: String) {
        // Log an event when the app receives ON_RESUME (e.g. comes to foreground)
        LifecycleEventEffect(Lifecycle.Event.ON_RESUME) {
            Analytics.logView(screenName)
        }
    }
    
**Warning:** You can't use `LifecycleEventEffect` to listen for `Lifecycle.Event.ON_DESTROY` because the composition ends and the composable is disposed of before this signal is sent.
### LifecycleStartEffect
For paired start/stop operations that need to run while the app is started (visible) and clean up when the app is stopped (in the background), use [`LifecycleStartEffect`](/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/compose/package-summary#LifecycleStartEffect\(kotlin.Any,androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleOwner,kotlin.Function1\)).
Similar to other Compose effects (like `LaunchedEffect`), `LifecycleStartEffect` accepts keys. When the key changes, it triggers the block to run again.
When a `Lifecycle.Event.ON_STOP` event occurs or the effect exits the composition, it executes the `onStopOrDispose` block to clean up any work that was part of the starting block.
    
    @Composable
    fun LocationMonitor(locationManager: LocationManager) {
        // Starts monitoring when ON_START is dispatched
        // Stops monitoring when ON_STOP is dispatched
        //   (or the composable leaves the screen)
        LifecycleStartEffect(locationManager) {
            val listener = LocationListener { location ->
                /* update UI */
            }
            locationManager.requestLocationUpdates(listener)
            // The cleanup block automatically runs on ON_STOP or on disposal
            onStopOrDispose {
                locationManager.removeUpdates(listener)
            }
        }
    }
    
**Note:** The `onStopOrDispose` block is always required for a `LifecycleStartEffect`. If your operation doesn't actually require cleanup, use `LifecycleEventEffect` instead, passing in `Lifecycle.Event.ON_START`.
For information about other types of side effects, see [Side-effects in Compose](/develop/ui/compose/side-effects).
### LifecycleResumeEffect
The `LifecycleResumeEffect` works in the same way as the `LifecycleStartEffect`, but it is tied to the `Lifecycle.Event.ON_RESUME` event instead. It also provides an `onPauseOrDispose` block that performs the cleanup when `ON_PAUSE` is dispatched or the composable leaves the screen.
This API is useful for resources that need to be active only when the user is interacting with the app—for example, cameras or animations.
    
    @Composable
    fun CameraPreview(cameraController: CameraController) {
        LifecycleResumeEffect(cameraController) {
            cameraController.startPreview()
    
            onPauseOrDispose {
                cameraController.stopPreview()
            }
        }
    }
    
## Access the LifecycleOwner
In Compose, the [`LifecycleOwner`](/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/LifecycleOwner) is implicitly available through the `CompositionLocal` named `LocalLifecycleOwner`. By default, the root host of your composition hierarchy provides this owner.
    
    val lifecycleOwner = LocalLifecycleOwner.current
    
For many apps, inspecting this default owner or passing it to lifecycle-aware effects is sufficient. However, for custom navigation or complex layouts, you might want to create your own `LifecycleOwner` to scope lifecycle states to specific sections of the UI. For example, navigation libraries (like [Navigation 3](/guide/navigation/navigation-3)) do this automatically to give each individual screen its own lifecycle.
### Create a custom LifecycleOwner
The `rememberLifecycleOwner()` API lets you create and remember a custom `LifecycleOwner`. This is especially useful for components like a `HorizontalPager`, where you want only the visible, settled page to be `RESUMED`, while setting a `maxState` of `STARTED` for the adjacent, off-screen pages.
    
    val pagerState = rememberPagerState(pageCount = { 10 })
    
    HorizontalPager(state = pagerState) { pageNum ->
        val pageLifecycleOwner = rememberLifecycleOwner(
            maxState = if (pagerState.settledPage == pageNum) {
                Lifecycle.State.RESUMED
            } else {
                Lifecycle.State.STARTED
            }
        )
    
        CompositionLocalProvider(LocalLifecycleOwner provides pageLifecycleOwner) {
            // Your pages here. Their lifecycle-aware components respect the
            // custom maxState defined above.
        }
    }

## Best practices for lifecycle-aware components
  * Keep your UI controllers as lean as possible. They should not try to acquire their own data; instead, use a [`ViewModel`](/reference/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel) to do that, and observe a `StateFlow` object to reflect the changes back to the UI.
  * Try to write data-driven UIs where your UI controller’s responsibility is to update the UI as data changes, or notify user actions back to the [`ViewModel`](/reference/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel).
  * Put your data logic in your [`ViewModel`](/reference/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel) class. [`ViewModel`](/reference/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel) should serve as the connector between your UI controller and the rest of your app. Be careful though, it isn't [`ViewModel`](/reference/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel)'s responsibility to fetch data (for example, from a network). Instead, [`ViewModel`](/reference/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel) should call the appropriate component to fetch the data, then provide the result back to the UI controller.
  * Use [Kotlin coroutines](/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines) to manage long-running tasks and other operations that can run asynchronously.
  * Keep start/stop logic inside the composable that actually needs it. This way, the logic is automatically removed if that specific UI element is removed from the screen (for example, inside a navigation graph or when visibility is conditional).
  * Use `collectAsStateWithLifecycle` for data. Do not manually start or stop `Flow` collection based on lifecycle events. Instead, use `collectAsStateWithLifecycle` to convert streams into UI state efficiently. This saves battery and resources because `Flow`s are paused when the app is in the background.


For more information on `Flow`s, see [Other supported types of state](/develop/ui/compose/state#use-other-types-of-state-in-jetpack-compose).
## Use cases for lifecycle-aware components
Lifecycle-aware components can make it much easier for you to manage lifecycles in a variety of cases. A few examples are:
  * Switching between coarse and fine-grained location updates. Use `LifecycleStartEffect` to enable fine-grained location updates while your app is visible (`ON_START`), and automatically clean up the listener or switch to coarse-grained updates when the app is in the background (`ON_STOP`).
  * Stopping and starting video buffering. Use `LifecycleResumeEffect` to defer actual video playback until the app is fully in the foreground and interactive (`ON_RESUME`), and to make sure that playback pauses and releases resources when the app is backgrounded (`ON_PAUSE`).
  * Starting and stopping network streaming. Use `collectAsStateWithLifecycle` to observe continuous streams of data (like a Kotlin Flow from a network socket). This gives you live updating while an app is in the foreground and automatically cancels collection when the app goes into the background.
  * Pausing and resuming heavy tasks. Use `LifecycleResumeEffect` to handle pausing heavy visual updates when the app is in the background, and resume them after the app is in the foreground.


## Handling ON_STOP events safely
Compose is designed to handle `ON_STOP` events safely.
  * **State is safe:** You can update `MutableState` (for example, with `uiState.value = ...`) at any time, even when the app is in the background. Compose waits until the app is visible to render the changes.
  * **Automatic cleanup:** With effects like `LifecycleStartEffect`, your cleanup block (`onStopOrDispose`) runs exactly when the lifecycle moves to `STOPPED`. This prevents you from holding heavy resources (like camera or location) while the app is in the background.


For more information on `MutableState`, see [State and Jetpack Compose](/develop/ui/compose/state).
